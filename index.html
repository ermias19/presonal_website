        Trevor Noah, Born a Crime
Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood

The book details Trevor Noah growing up in his native South Africa
tduring the apartheid era. As the mixed-race son of a white father
and a black mother, Noah himself was classified as a "colored" in accordanceto the apartheid system of racial classification. According to Noah, he stated that even under apartheid


he felt trouble fitting in because it was a crime "for [him] to be born as a mixed-race baby", hence the title of his book.
At the time of his birth, however, mixed marriages had already been decriminalised; the laws concerning mixed relations were scrapped altogether.
